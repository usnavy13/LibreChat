 * Points one model-facing message at content free of the summary parts that

 * scan takes the last summary part carrying text as the conversation's history
 * boundary and drops every message before it, reading neither `failed` nor
 * `summarizing`: a round that errored or was cut off keeps the deltas it
 * streamed, so leaving that part in would replace the history it never
 * finished summarizing with the prefix it produced. An empty summary is left
 * alone — it bounds nothing, and the renderer owns how it appears.
 *
 * The message gets a NEW content array rather than a spliced one, because a
 * formatted prompt copy shares its content array with the stored message it
 * came from: splicing would reindex the persisted row's parts under every
 * reader that holds it. This belongs on a prompt copy before its token count
 * is taken, so the count, the prompt total an admission check reads, and any
 * later per-index adjustment all describe what the model actually receives.
